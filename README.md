# GTA-San-Fixed-And-Improved
**This guide is for every pc no matter your specs (low-end/mid-range/ high end)**
<br>
<br>
GTA San andreas is old and outdated so with this guide we will fix that

Do not install Install gta on Program File / Program Files(x86)

Use Mod Loader to install the mods unless stated otherwise.

Install the mods one by one and test the game each time to make sure it works.

Never run the game with more than 60 FPS as physics, animations and even missions start to break.

You might need to start a New Game after installing all the mods to avoid any incompatibilities.

Improvising this mods list should be done ONLY if you know what you are doing and AT YOUR OWN RISK!
